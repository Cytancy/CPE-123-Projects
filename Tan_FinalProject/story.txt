	The story of Dorothy	

Oof! That really hu- (exc)

...where am I? (question mark)
My..my head..I don't feel quite right.

Why can't I seem to remember..

..anything..?

I..

..I feel as if I'm in pain. 

My mind..

..it's going to pieces.

I best find a way out before I lose it.




This road! (exc)

It's..it's so bright..

I feel..like it's calling to me..

------------------------------------------

A dead end..? (question)
Why is there a road that leads to nowhere?
Why can't I get where I'm going?
Where..
..where am I going? 
..and why does my head hurt so much?

------------------------------------------

Crow: I see, I see, so you have returned. (exc)
Drawn to this path of brilliance I see?

Who..who are you? (question)

I am crow, an old friend, or foe? You've no recall? The four of us; us all. All friends to your call.

...

No words to say? No time to play? It is fine, today is a day. It is the return of Dorothy, a maiden per se.

..Dorothy?

Your name yes? Of course, it fits best. It's a name among names, known for its fame.

I..see.

You see? That cannot be. 

What do you mean..?

The gift of sight is for those in the right.

I am in the..right?

No, no, you've lose your way, you are a stray, my dear, you are not okay.

I'm am okay, I've no idea what you're saying.

The void in your head. Empty instead. You've lost your mind, and it's painful to find.

You..know about my headache?

A headache? This is no such small thing. The emptiness in your head has great troubles to bring.  

Like what..?

For one, you've lost your sight, for two, you'll lose your light, and for three, your time is tight.

Time?

You've only so much, you must hurry, before you lose touch.

Than I must be on my way, thank your for your help.

My help? My help does not end here, I will lend you my mind so you can endear.

Thank you, err..Crow. But why your mind?

Because you've been kind. You've helped me get mine mind. It has been quite a long time, back then I did not rhyme.

Back then..huh. Unfortunately, I can't remember.

It is fine my dear, but go on, leave here.
Finish the road, find the gold.

You mean the bridge? How?

You now have my mind, you now have some sight. It will guide as a light, and lead you alright.

I see..

Of course, yes, you barely do. Goodbye, I now must be gone too.

//======================

What is this, a brick?

This must be the "gold" Crow was talking about.

I guess, I'll take this with-

Wait, somethings not right.

My head, it's being..
..flooded

//========different fonts

Mom, 

are you coming home soon?

I'm already boarding the plane sweetie, I'll be there as soon as I can.

Thanks mom, I..I..

..just really miss you. 

I don't think I can deal with all this.. ..alone.

It's alright honey, I'll always be there when you need me.

//=============

Act 2
Heartbreak

...

..what..
was that..?

A memory..?

.."mom"..?

This word..
..it sounds so warm..

.."warm"..?
I can't seem to remember the meaning..

..! 

My chest..! 
It..hurts..

This pain, why?

...

I better get going, it takes more than one brick to finish a road.

Ah, it's you.
You, you, you.

It's good to see you again dear,
come o'here. Give me a hug!

...?!

Why are you hugging me! Get off me! 

You must be kidding me! You don't want a hug from your old, old friend?

Fortunately, I'm glad I don't remember you.

That hurts. But you're forgiven, you're Dorothy after all.

You..know my name?

And you know mine?

...

No.

I'm heartbroken! But you're forgiven, I'm 
the Tinman, and I'm glad we're meeting again.

I see..?

Oh, of course you do, I see ol' crow must have lended you a bit of his mind. What a fine mind he has.

You know Crow?

And he knows me! Anyways, I heard you were looking for bricks?

Ah, yes, the "gold".

Is that what Crow is calling them these days? What a laugh!

Anyways, you'll probably be needing my help for the next one. There's actually four in all. 

Four, that's not many..
..and why do you need my help?

Because you're lost again dear!

Lost? But I can see.

But, you can't feel, my dear.

I can feel just fine.

Hardly! You've lost your heart darling. Don't you dare say otherwise.

My heart?

Yes, your heart, and without your heart..
..how could you ever survive?

There's no joy, no fun, no surprise, and most of all, no love!

Love..?

Yes, love. 
With love you can jump with joy, be elated with surprise, even leap bounds!

Hmph.

Well, anyways, you need a heart. Take mine out for a spin, you'll find love soon enough.

Thanks..?

Another brick!
All that jumping was quite a bit of fun..
Maybe a heart isn't so bad after-

!..
It's happening again..

My head..I'm falling..

...

..mom?

The number you have dialed is currently unavailable. Please hang up and try again.

..mom..?!

The number you have dialed is currently unavailable. Please hang up and try again.

..MOM?!

The number you have dialed is currently unavailable. Please hang up and try again.

...

...why...?

Act 3
Braving the Past

...
Another memory?

This one was..
..painful..

Mom..?
I don't think I can go on much longer..

...

I'm afraid..

..but..
just two more.

I sense fear in you.

...
//==============

Fear not lass! The great knight Leo has come to your aid.

My aid? I am quite fine thank you.

Fine? If only you were so fortunate.

How am I not fine..?

You lack something of great importance, and without it, you will fail.

What could you mean..?

I have a mind and a heart, what more could I need? A liver?

Ah, well, you're definitely not missing a sense of humor.

Haha?

Ahem. 

What you're lacking is courage, I sense the emptiness in you. Your fear..

..It is all-consuming. 

...


Be honest with yourself Dorothy.
It is okay to be afraid.

I'm trembling..

Do not waver, if you believe, courage will carry you through.

So you will lend me yours?

No, I won't. 

...

It is not that I am any less generous than Crow or Tin. It is that courage is not something that is given..

...?

..It is something that is earned. 

Something that comes from within.

It is neither the absence of fear nor the unwillingness to accept it. 

It is facing your fears... 

..to do what you are afraid to do..

..because you realize something is more important.

It is a will to overcome, Dorothy.

..To let go of the familiar and forge ahead into new territory..

...

But..
I'm not sure I can do it on my own...

Do not invest in self-doubt Dorothy.

Just remember this. Be brave, and there is nothing you cannot do.




..the third brick!

I guess Leo was right..
..even in someone like me..

..there is courage.

I just need to set my mind to it.

I'm feeling a bit dizzy..
..I guess this brick will reveal another memory.



Third brick at last! Just one more..
I'm getting a little bit dizzy..

I guess..
..it's going to happen again..


...

..Dad, I..

..I can't be here..

..It's..It's...

..all my fau-!

It's not your fault Dorothy!

B-but..

No buts!

...

..b-but I made her get on that plane..

No..no..you didn't.. 

She came because..
 
..she cared about you very much..

I can't stand to be here..	

..if only..

..I was a bit more..

..self-sufficient.

..no, Dorothy, don't go..

but..

..I'm the reason she died!

You know that isn't true!

Wait, Dorothy, you don't know where you're going!

I don't care!

Dorothy, WATCH OUT!


...!

...

..these memories..

..they're so painful.

..I can still hear the sound..
..of twisting metal.

I can see why I was trying to forget.

But I can't give up now. 

Even if the future is uncertain and frightening.

I can't let Crow, Tinman, Leo, and most of all, myself, down.

After trying so hard to forget..?

..! I made it
































I made it!
I finally made it..
I can finally finish the bridge. And get to where I'm going..

...I'm feeling
..lightheaded.

...

I guess it's time to get ready..


...

Dorothy..?

Doooorothy?

Hey girl, you there?

Waaaaaake up..?

Honey?

I guess she isn't very responsive today Doctor.

Unfortunately.

However, she is showing signs of improvement.

The recent scans look promising.

Try to be hopeful.

We can only hope for the best.

Right guys?

Yep!

Mhm.

Of course!


All we can do is be there for her.

And be by her side..

As we eagerly await her return

Thank you, all of you.

For visiting my daughter.

I hope so..

But I'll face it the best I can..
